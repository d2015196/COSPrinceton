6. chatlog0.txt, chartlog1.txt, chattlog2.txt found on Bob's machine serve as sufficient evidence that Bob and Alice committed the crime. The image file,, shows a sketch of the Cornell and Dartmouth mascots on their way to the Princeton campus. Thus this image also supports this conclusion. However, msg1.txt.enc reveals that Mallory, along with the Info Sec staff, framed Bob for this crime. 

7. Bob's and Alice's motivation, as framed by Mallory and the Info Sec staff, was their resentment of the mascots at Ivy League schools. On the other hand, the the framer's motivation was to get get Bob locked up for years to come. 

8. Yes. Without considering msg1.txt.enc, Alice and Bob appear to have committed the crime. However msg1.txt.enc confirms that Bob was just framed for the crime by Sketchy Corp and the (sketchier) COS 432 instructors.
